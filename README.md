# GenerativeAI-LangChain

This repository contains Generative AI Project! This project is designed to handle frequently asked questions for any institute, aiming to create a chatbot where users can easily ask their queries.

In this project, I used Googleâ€™s PaLM API integrated with LangChain, diverging from the usual LLM models. To convert my dataset into embeddings, I utilized HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings and employed FAISS for efficient vector storage, all seamlessly integrated with LangChain. Additionally, I built an interactive UI using Streamlit, allowing users to ask questions and engage with the model.

I'm continuously working on improving this project and exploring new possibilities.
